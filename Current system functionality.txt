Currently this is what the system supports:

- Full ROM-style command interpreting, including 5.pie 10*point and 'quotes around things' in "multiple varieties"

- Instead of returning string arguments for the code to parse in your command, you can get an argument returned that has a reference to the Thing you desire (a Mob or Obj) that's already been location verified (in your Inventory or in the local Room)


- Handles all telnet connectivity (except dropping a link ATM), managing them in one thread per person


- Has a GameLoop that handles all timing, similar to ROM it uses "pulses" - although there are 10 pulses per second (also configurable like ROM) per default

- Buffers up all input/output to players and sends it out on each pulse, also like ROM - this reduces overall bandwidth consumption by combining packets


- Number of game commands currently supported - directional movement, basic look, who, say, score, and working on combat commands now
